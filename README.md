# Principal Component Analysis to analyze a breast tumor dataset

## Setup using Poetry

For an easier setup, use [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) as the dependency management.

```bash
# clone this repo with 
git clone https://github.com/chrissiwaffler/pca-breast-tumor.git

# installing all python dependencies
poetry install
```

Afterwards, make sure to select the poetry virtual environment when starting the IPython kernel.

All results and explanation of the approach are documented in the Jupyter notebook (`pca.ipynb`) file.
Figures generated by the Notebook are saved in the `figures/` directory.
