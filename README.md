# Principal Component Analysis to analyze a breast tumor dataset

## About

This is the codebase for the section VI of my paper, where principal component analysis (PCA) is applied to a breast tumor dataset.
All graphics and results used can be generated using the `pca.iypnb` notebook.

For more information about PCA and its derivation and application, please refer to my paper (`pca.pdf`)

## Setup using Poetry

For an easier setup, use [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) as the dependency management.

```bash
# clone this repo with 
git clone https://github.com/chrissiwaffler/pca-breast-tumor.git

# installing all python dependencies
poetry install
```

Afterwards, make sure to select the poetry virtual environment when starting the IPython kernel.

---

All results and explanation of the approach are documented in the Jupyter notebook (`pca.ipynb`) file.
Figures generated by the Notebook are saved in the `figures/` directory.
